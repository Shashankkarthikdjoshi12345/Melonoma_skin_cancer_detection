# Melonoma_skin_cancer_detection
This project talks about the creating a deep learning model using Convolutional neural network to detect melonoma skin cancer

__Melonoma__, a type of skin cancer is fatal and almost a common type of skin cancer when detected in early stages could be cureable.
Hence it is exteremly important to detect the visible abnomality on the skin to save the precious life
The dataset consists of multiple images of skin deficiencies with visible abnomilaties.
Our task is to detect these abnormal growth/skin layers out of all type of images provided to us.

The dataset consists of Train and test spilt images upon which we train and test the model respectively..
